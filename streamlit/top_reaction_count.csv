I know that I will be introduced to alto of useful tools and concepts, but without the appropriate sources it useless.
maybe the resources are here but no guide lines to see where to read.

2. Confused people who aren't sure which way to go.  I assume that these people worry about their future, instead of focussing on one thing only (getting the first job).  I'd love to chat openly with these people to help them make a good first choice.
3. Dreamers, who hope that because of passion and superhuman effort, they will 'beat the system'.  Those who aim to double-jump the twin gaps of first global-level job and getting a job in a field that they don't have the requisite experience for.  Most of this group wants to go for an ML Eng role without SWEng experience.  To this group, I would ask: What would you rather be doing this time next year - a global-level DE job or a local ML job?

message,"I definitely caused some confusion so to clear things up --

From a fresh setup, you start off with these commands by initializing a git and a DVC repository
```git init
dvc init
git commit -m ""initial commit""```
You then follow on to set the DVC remote -- this is the MOST crucial step and should be done first because messing with different remotes and then tracking the changes on multiple unsynchronized remotes will lead to unnecessary complications as we saw.
```dvc remote add -d myremote <gdrive://folderid>
git commit -m ""sets dvc remote""```
the remote URL can be in your local file system but using google drive will be really helpful for collaboration as you are working in teams. Please follow this <https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/setup-google-drive-remote|link> to learn more.

After this will follow the steps where you will actually track the data.
```dvc add path_to_data
git add path_to_data.dvc
git commit -m ""data:track""```
You then tag the specific commit and then push it to your DVC remote using `dvc push`
```git tag -a 'v1' -m ""raw data""
dvc push```
The final two steps are the only steps that are necessary and the steps you'll iterate over and over once DVC and your DVC remote are set and you start making changes to your data.",Mandy Sweeney,1662073315.332009,text,1662073315.332009,2,2,"U03U1FNPEUX,U03UJN29Y4C",1662477316.800639,

message,"Q1 - Tell me about yourself (2-3 minutes)
Q2 - How did you get to your current status as a (MLEng, DataEng)
Q3 - Take me through a project that you are proud of
Q4 - 3-4 questions that you would ask them for the role/company

For Q1 - forget the job, tell them about you to start. Give them a why, if you have one. What is important to you.
• Your name in  full
• Where you live
• What you are doing right now
• What your university education was - which course. Mention notable courses and projects. Mention challenges as well, if any.
• Link to 10 Academy - why did you apply? How does it link to your future goals.
• Overview of what you learned at 10 Academy. Sprinkle in keywords on technologies that you have used. Look at the list of expertise keywords in the careers doc.
• You don't need to close it off with a 'hire me' - it's one part of the discussion.
• You should feel free to talk about things that you like. Your parents, kids, cats, neighbours....etc.
It's a summary of who you are and where you come from

For Q2 - Your background in MLEng and Data Eng
• Start with your university - which courses did you take that were relevant?
• Highlight your math and your algorithms and other related courses
• Talk about student projects or internships that were relevant - mention them in the frame of MLEng or DEng - what aspects of them were related
• Talk about 10 Academy and highlight 2-3 key projects that you are proud of, and which could be related to what the employer is interested in. If the job is NLP, talk about Speech to Text and especially the processing part.  If the job is ETL, talk about your pipeline buliding
• Talk about any self-learning including which resources you used
• Give a summary of your background at the end as it relates to the whole stack. So that you have some background in Data Eng, you have worked on different models, you have deep expertise in Python and SQL, you have done some CI/CD and ML DevOps, visualization and reporting. Tie it together and show that you know where your expertise fits in the overall context.
Q3 - Be ready to walk them through a project that is relevant, in a lot of detail.
• Have your notebook clean and ready to present and walk though.
• Be ready to explain approaches you took
• Be ready to explain why you chose one approach over other approaches
• Be ready to talk about things that you realize you didn't do as well as you could have
• Be ready to talk about things that you would have implemented, given the time
• Be ready to talk about where you would take the project next
Q4 - Prepare questions for the company and the role
• This is one of the most important things - it’s your opportunity to showcase the type of thinker that you are.
• Ask meaningful questions that you would be likely to ask if you started work and it was Day 1.

•  Logo detection and button positioning was the most challenging part, and the fact that it’s also global issue, companies like Amazon faced the same issue, and they invested on teams andbuilt huge  infrastructure for over coming this problem.
• The challeng was all the available solutions work as API and we can’t risk our sensitive data to be sent to third parties, also the available models need to be trained on large amount of data to solve the issue besided it will cost time and money to do that. 
*Proposed solution:*
• We used a creative way that maixmize the quality of results while minimizing the cost, 
• We used template matching method wich is available in OpenCv library.
• We gave the model a picture of the logo and aske it to locae it’s position on the image.
• We extracted the Starting coordination  points of the logo in the image plus the hight and the width of it.
• The result was more than 60% of the logo positions was detected ,and more than 80% of engagement buttons was detecte also.
*Future recommendations* 
• Train our own model to get accurate results
• We should use Yolo 7 as a model

<@U03UG5VFN03> So the final product is going to be a web page that presents some sentence to users and your page should allow users to record/upload audio format of the sentence(you might deploy it if you want). And your application should communicate with your kafka cluster. Then apply spark to transform and load your audio data from the kafka cluster.

Kitchens in a restaurant, serving hundreds of people.
• Data Scientists are the head chefs, figuring out the recipes that people want to eat and which fit the budget.
• ML Engineers do the cooking for people at scale.  They use the ingredients from DEng and the recipes from DSci.
• Data Engineers ensure that all the ingredients are coming into the kitchen, prepared and ready.  No ingredients, no food. Choosing good quality ingredients and preparing them well is hard.

message,"*CLARIFICATION ON LEADERBOARD SCORES*

<!channel> Having received a number of complaints or clarity about leaderboard scores, it’s imperative to give a detailed explanation on how leaderboard scores are calculated. 

It is essential to note that the following components constitute your leaderboard scores: 
• Technical submission 
• Non-technical submission 
• Standup and tutorial attendance 
• Slack participation 
There are standard scores for each of these components. On the leaderboard section of tenx, we have ‘*week score*’ and ‘*previous week* score’ - your week score is the cumulative of all previous weeks including the present week. For example, the *week score*  of the week 5 leaderboard is the cumulative of week1 to week5, not week 5 alone. You can also view this example like the grading system of university CGPA. Consequently, your previous weeks scores will affect all your new scores.

If you have any further question, you can kindly reach out to me. Do have a restful weekend and a great month ahead. ",Garrett Bell,1664562464.941529,text,0,0,0,0,0,

• For each version of the data do the following
    ◦ Split the data into 70% training, 20% validation, and 10% test sets. 
    ◦ Based on the reading material provided, apply machine learning to the training data. Train a machine learning model using 5-fold cross validation using the following 3 different algorithms:
        ▪︎ *Logistic Regression* 
        ▪︎ Decision Trees
        ▪︎ *XGBoost*
        ▪︎ *RandomForest*
    ◦ Define the appropriate loss function  for the model using the validation data. 
    ◦ Compute feature importance - what’s driving the model? Which parameters are important predictors for the different ML models? What contributes to the goal of gaining more “Yes” results?
    ◦ Which data features are relevant to predicting the target variable?
    ◦ For each of the ML algorithms above, find the best model by tuning their hyperparameters and each time adding the tried models in MLFlow.
    ◦ Prepare a Dockerfile for your project so that your model can be deployed in a docker container.

• firstly, all of the provided documents are good but does not help very much when it comes to tasks, it kind off building general intuition about a topic.
• secondly, what I assume it will fit my needs is ,  same week project doc with attached  links or key words to guide us in our searching for each task separately. for example, could be a figure under each task listing links and helpful key words.
• Thirdly, in tutorials, it be very helpful if the tutors explained which functions we will be using in our week project , and linking directly where we will use the tool or the topic he is explaining right now in the project or tasks. and this maybe for the first few weeks when we are trying to familiarize ourselves with flow of work and calm down the stress

Here in 10Academy, we train our trainees on solving problems rather than reinventing the wheels. Most of the resources will only equip you with basic understanding of concepts, ability to apply the concept to solve challenges is one of the skills we require you to develop. Also, you should not be limited to the resources provided in the challenge document - you can expand your wings just to get the job done.

message,"If you struggle with procrastination, these 5 tips below can help you make progress and stay on track. Remember, sometimes, being aware of the problem can help you take steps to overcome it.
• *Set small goals*: The thought of completing one huge task can seem daunting. Having a list of small and achievable goals can help you tackle each one, in turn, meaning that you make gradual progress towards completion.
• *Organize your tasks*: The point above feeds into this one. You can stay motivated to accomplish your main goals by creating a precise schedule with dates (daily, weekly and monthly) for when you will achieve each of your smaller goals.
•  *Focus your attention*: Concentrating on some of the simpler activities you need to complete is another method for overcoming procrastination. This is a major confidence booster to achieve set tasks
• *Remove distractions*: They can easily derail your progress, whether it’s having your phone next to you on your desk or having the TV on in the background. Ensure you create a comfortable working environment where distractions can't thrive.
• *Forgive yourself*: It's easy to punish yourself for putting off tasks. You might tell yourself that you're being ineffective or lazy. In actuality, doing this to yourself doesn't increase productivity; it just makes you feel more agitated and nervous. So learn to forgive yourself always.

message,"[There is] an old Zen saying, ‘Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water; after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.’ The enlightened are distinguished from the rest of us not by the work they do but by the _manner in which they do their work._ No matter how much life wisdom a person acquires, the chores of daily life remain the same. The enlightened, however, do not do their daily work as a mere means to an end: The chopping of the wood is not done for the purpose of building a fire, and the carrying of the water is not done for the purpose of cooking food, because everything is done in the same state of presence, for its own sake, without goals.

message,"Blog written by <https://medium.com/@kevn.wanf?source=post_page-----de2cde8ea599--------------------------------|Kevin Wang> on Mar 6, 2020 described causal inference by taking the following examples. Every year, 1.1 million premature babies die. In other words, 7.3% of all premature babies die _every single year._ Millions of parents have to struggle through the grief, suffering, and pain of losing their child over a process they can’t control. That’s a problem. Let’s say we want to figure out whether comprehensive treatment after the birth of a premature baby will affect its chances for survival. In order to solve this problem, we need to use causal inference.",Yvonne Gonzalez,1666365123.399859,text,0,0,0,0,0,

message,"OK here goes

1. Is to actually know or plan what you want to visualize or show on your dashboard. Usually, almost all the things I did for myself.
2. Next, you install stream lit or your desired mode of visualizer modules like Heroku. I prefer stream lit because I never really worked with Heroku.
3. After installing everything, you then use all your pre-written scripts here for your advantage. Meaning you can directly use all the methods and helper functions you have already written for your dashboard demonstration. Especially all your data visualization scripts.
4. Then you will create a python file or files containing the streamlit module to do the dashboard. At this point, it all comes to using the streamlit module to make and show your dashboard. You don't have to exactly show each and everything as you did in your notebook. You can make many other kinds of visualization in streamlit.
5. Finally, after you completed what you want to show using your python file or files, you then can just use the official streamlit website to host your demonstrations publicly.
Here are some reference links
1. Getting started with streamlit. <https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started>
2. Hosting apps to streamlit. <https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-cloud/get-started/deploy-an-app>

Welcome to 10 Academy slack workspace. We will be using this platform to communicate with the trainees and share resources needed throughout the training. To have a well organized workspace, we have created different channels for specific purposes. The following are the list of channels in this workspace and their respective purposes:

*<#C03U4J8J4LQ|all-broadcast> ;* This channel will be used for sharing important information and announcements such as weekly schedule, session reminders, leaderboard and so on. Only 10 Academy team can post on this channel.

<#C03T89KDGA2|all-career-exercises>: This channel will be used for sharing career related issues and exercises. Trainees should adopt this channel to ask questions and share resources that are peculiar to Career. This channel is open for all trainees.

<#C03T0AX4K6K|all-technical-support>: Trainees should adopt this channel to ask questions related to tenx platform, google classroom, google meet and slack platform.

<#C03T89PMJKG|all-resources>: For easy easy access to resources shared, trainees should use this channel to share valuable resources such as books, videos, articles and so on.

*<#C03TEQQS9NF|all-week1>* : This channel is used for asking questions related to week1 challenge. 10 Academy tutors will be available to answer your questions as fast as possible. However, trainees can also answer another trainee’s questions - provided he/she is sure of the answer. In addition, trainees should answer questions in a thread so that the channel can be organized and other trainees can also benefit from such questions. Please note that we will always create a new channel weekly such as #all-week2, #all-week3 and so on.

*<#C03T0APHX63|all-community-building>  :* This group was created with the objective of growing a formidable bond among batch 6 trainees and 10 Academy team. We will be using this channel for community building sessions, social and community building discussions.  This channel is open to all trainees.


*<#C03TBUCU4UD|random>  :* This group is for discussions that are not related to the training such as choice of music, politics, football and so on.

It is imperative to inform all trainees to have mutual respect for fellow trainees and avoid use of offensive words.",Garrett Bell,1661240139.447569,text,0,0,0,0,0,

• How : This standup will be coordinated by trainees yourself 
    ◦ You will pick and agree on the topic of discussion by Monday but it has to be related to the week 12 challenge
    ◦ You will select a moderator - session lead to facilitate the discussion 
    ◦ We should have the moderator nominated by Monday 12:00 UTC
• We will observe as 10 Academy how it goes and think of how to implement similar approaches for the next batches or can choose another day for the rest the week 12 to go similar.  ",Garrett Bell,1667568888.543719,text,0,0,0,0,0,

message,"I think the best thing to do here is to have your own schedule. Everyone has a different attitude and approach toward things. And therefore the Aluminis advice might not be applicable to some and might be even bottom line impossible for others. And therefore I would like to recommend to you based on my imperceptible wisdom to have your own schedule at the beginning of the week. Take a look at that week's challenge doc. see what we are supposed to deliver (on the deliverables section) and after you understand what we need to complete and by when you then plan out the week. Now I think the most important part about the schedule is following it, you might not complete everything on time, and you might finish some before the allotted time frame ends, But for the unfinished tasks don't waste too much unscheduled time on them, as they will definitely take up the other tasks time. So by planning and following your schedule even if you don't complete everything you might manage to get lots done.

Last but not least, don't forget other areas of your life in the meantime. Everyday balance is very necessary and is definitely, at least for me, what constitutes the good life.

Good luck, and Godspeed!",Travis Butler,1661428819.021849,text,1661426750.680949,0,0,0,0,

• Aggregate the above metrics per customer id (MSISDN) and report the top 10 customers per engagement metric 
• Normalize each engagement metric and run a k-means (k=3) to classify customers in three groups of engagement.

""Growing up, we say, as though we were trees, as though altitude was all that there was to be gained, but so much of the process is growing whole as the fragments are gathered, the patterns found. Human infants are born with craniums made up of four plates that have not yet knit together into a solid dome so that their heads can compress to fit through the birth canal so that the brain within can then expand. The seams of these plates are intricate, like fingers interlaced, like the meander of arctic rivers across the tundra.

The skull quadruples in size in the first few years, and if the bones knit together too soon, they restrict the growth of the brain; and if they don't knit at all the brain remains unprotected. Open enough to grow and closed enough to hold together is what life must also be. We collage ourselves into being, finding the pieces of a worldview and people to love and reasons to live and then integrate them into a whole, a life consistent with its beliefs and desires, at least if we're lucky.""",Travis Butler,1668145604.667999,text,0,0,0,0,0,

• We need somebody to take the advanced EDA,
• We need somebody to take the airflow dags.
Among the comments logging, MLFlow and testing are already done with remaining minor touches.

SO WHO IS WILLING TO TAKE THE ABOVE BULLETED TASKS.

Comment from the tutors is as follows
```1. Most members of the group did EDA yet non is completely extensive, most are not commented and only Adijat uses markdown. Better to have one group member doing the EDA and do it extensively. Nonetheless. great audio visualizations and explorations.
2. There's no setup of CML at all and this was explicitly mentioned in the challenge document.
3. Was there an issue setting up and using Airflow?

Looking to see some improvement with week8 project.```

Semantic Segmentation
Semantic Segmentation is the task of segmenting parts of an image that belong to the same class. Semantic Segmentation models make predictions for each pixel and return the probabilities of the classes for each pixel. These models are evaluated on Mean Intersection Over Union (Mean IoU).

Instance Segmentation
Instance Segmentation is the variant of Image Segmentation where every distinct object is segmented, instead of one segment per class.

Panoptic Segmentation
Panoptic Segmentation is the Image Segmentation task that segments the image both by instance and by class, assigning each pixel a different instance of the class.",Travis Butler,1667239495.049429,text,0,0,0,0,0,

message,"I think you are right....
1. Read and research on prompt engineering and its algorithms
    a. understand transformer algorithm
    b. understand basics of GPT
2. Then, I believe the next step after setting up your repo is EDA on the given datasets and customizing the data to get better performances(results) from the co:here api.
    a. you will be working on creating the best input data out of the given dataset
    b. you consume the co:here API (simply send you prepared data to the api and you receive predictions from the model)
    c. Finally you put all these steps together by creating your own API
    d. your API should have two end-point ( i think they behave more or less the same): one endpoint for the news scoring and the other endpoint for extracting entities from job description
        i. So here is what you will do: your api should accept dataset(in json format possibly) then you transform, clean, feature engineer, the received data through your pipeline then send the prepared data to the co:here API, (notice there are two APIs involving in this project)....then you present the results via UI
Your API accept data-&gt;you transform data through pipeline-&gt;send prepared data to co:here-&gt; receive predictions -&gt; return the results to the user via UI

I think of it like this.

Kitchens in a restaurant, serving hundreds of people.
• Data Scientists are the head chefs, figuring out the recipes that people want to eat and which fit the budget.
• ML Engineers do the cooking for people at scale.  They use the ingredients from DEng and the recipes from DSci.
• Data Engineers ensure that all the ingredients are coming into the kitchen, prepared and ready.  No ingredients, no food. Choosing good quality ingredients and preparing them well is hard.
• MLOps folks build and maintain the kitchen infrastructure (stoves, ovens, etc.).

data scientist can do what data engineer do? but is reverse ok?

<@U03U93GNNVB>

Knew that experience is important. But we always heard from everyone here that not having the background does not matter. The mindset is to be ready to learn and to actually do the best to learn. Now, on the point of getting job, it seems like having a software engineering background is required everywhere (either ML, DE or Web3). Having interest is not enough and pratical. Employers are just looking for demonstration of experience. And the matter is that, it's like it's improbable to learn all the requirements in 3-6 months if you did not have at least a minimum of experience. So, how do people with no work experience nor software background will be able to make it?

message,"One of my favourite analogies is the one used to describe Zero Knowledge Proofs.
Normally, if you want to send a crypto asset, say Bitcoin, the network would first verify if you have the said amount of Bitcoin in the first place. But for privacy conscious users of blockchain, Zero Knowledge Proof provide a cryptographic proof of ownership without revealing too much information to the network.
Though a zero-knowledge proof is a sophisticated method of authenticating a transaction without revealing much details about it, the analogy below breaks down its most basic function.

Let's say <@U03UUMM7Y8H> is colourblind but doesn't know it. Now <@U03UKGSDGSG> needs to proof to Yasabneh that there's a difference between green and red. She gives Yasabneh two snooker balls, one green and one red but they are otherwise identical.

Yasabneh couldn't see the difference and he's pretty skeptical. To verify Hermela's claim that they are indeed different in colour, he device a proof system.

Yasabneh holds one snooker ball in each hand and put them behind his back. He either switches the balls or just leaves them be.

There's an equal chance of switching and not switching. He then brings them out from his back. Hermela now has to guess whether Yasabneh switched the balls or not. She can know with certainty whether Yasabneh switched the balls just by looking at the colours because she's not colourblind.

If she had lied, and the balls were of the same colour, then she only has 50% probability of guessing the switches correctly. So, one try wouldn't be enough to get Yasabneh convinced. Yasabneh and Hermela then go ahead to repeat this proof multiple times.

With each time Hermela gets it right, the chance it was just plan luck goes away. Yasabneh eventually is convinced that the balls are of different colours.

The proof is zero-knowledge because Yasabneh never learns which ball is green and which one is red. He just knows they're different colours.",Michelle Lewis,1661434221.694369,text,0,0,0,0,0,
