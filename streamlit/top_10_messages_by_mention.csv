1.When I was small my mum told me that if I swallowed chewing gum, it will tie my intestines together like a thread.

2.I asked how a baby was born to my cousin, she told me when a man and women just sleep together and i asked my cousin how come we don't have a baby then since we slept together. she said NOO, we gotta be adults and not related haha

3.My brother used to tell me if I swallowed orange seeds, it would grow inside my stomach and the leaves would come out of my mouth and ears. This one time I accidentally did and spent the whole night crying.

4.When I was a kid one of my friends told me that I shouldn't eat standing because the food goes down to my leg instead of digesting, until grade 4 I believed it to be true, I always ate sitting

Q2 - How did you get to your current status as a (MLEng, DataEng)
Q3 - Take me through a project that you are proud of
Q4 - 3-4 questions that you would ask them for the role/company

For Q1 - forget the job, tell them about you to start. Give them a why, if you have one. What is important to you.
• Your name in  full
• Where you live
• What you are doing right now
• What your university education was - which course. Mention notable courses and projects. Mention challenges as well, if any.
• Link to 10 Academy - why did you apply? How does it link to your future goals.
• Overview of what you learned at 10 Academy. Sprinkle in keywords on technologies that you have used. Look at the list of expertise keywords in the careers doc.
• You don't need to close it off with a 'hire me' - it's one part of the discussion.
• You should feel free to talk about things that you like. Your parents, kids, cats, neighbours....etc.
It's a summary of who you are and where you come from

For Q2 - Your background in MLEng and Data Eng
• Start with your university - which courses did you take that were relevant?
• Highlight your math and your algorithms and other related courses
• Talk about student projects or internships that were relevant - mention them in the frame of MLEng or DEng - what aspects of them were related
• Talk about 10 Academy and highlight 2-3 key projects that you are proud of, and which could be related to what the employer is interested in. If the job is NLP, talk about Speech to Text and especially the processing part.  If the job is ETL, talk about your pipeline buliding
• Talk about any self-learning including which resources you used
• Give a summary of your background at the end as it relates to the whole stack. So that you have some background in Data Eng, you have worked on different models, you have deep expertise in Python and SQL, you have done some CI/CD and ML DevOps, visualization and reporting. Tie it together and show that you know where your expertise fits in the overall context.
Q3 - Be ready to walk them through a project that is relevant, in a lot of detail.
• Have your notebook clean and ready to present and walk though.
• Be ready to explain approaches you took
• Be ready to explain why you chose one approach over other approaches
• Be ready to talk about things that you realize you didn't do as well as you could have
• Be ready to talk about things that you would have implemented, given the time
• Be ready to talk about where you would take the project next
Q4 - Prepare questions for the company and the role
• This is one of the most important things - it’s your opportunity to showcase the type of thinker that you are.
• Ask meaningful questions that you would be likely to ask if you started work and it was Day 1.

2. Confused people who aren't sure which way to go.  I assume that these people worry about their future, instead of focussing on one thing only (getting the first job).  I'd love to chat openly with these people to help them make a good first choice.
3. Dreamers, who hope that because of passion and superhuman effort, they will 'beat the system'.  Those who aim to double-jump the twin gaps of first global-level job and getting a job in a field that they don't have the requisite experience for.

```I learned at 10-Academy how to take charge of your own learning
Time management
Communicating with people remotely
There exists a big skill gap in tech in  Africa as compared to the world. 
Learning can be fun!
How to ask good questions
From the debate sessions, we should respect everyone's opinions.
Work output  stretches it self to the time you give it.
patience --code not work.......
They say it takes 60 days to create a habit, at 10 Academy , I definitely developed a habit of solving Data engineering and ML problems through coding.```

1. comment the `image` from docker-compose.yml
2. uncomment `build .`
3. add a `Dockerfile`  in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml file
    a. contents of Dockerfile should look like this
```FROM apache/airflow:2.2.0
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. add a requirement.txt that should contain `dbt==0.15`  I am not sure why other versions don't work, so use 0.15
5. place `profiles.yml`  in the dbt folder, also remove  `('seed-paths', 'model-paths', 'config-version')` tags from dbt-project.yml
6. use bash operator to run dbt commands
N.B. you shall use it as follows `dbt run --project-dir {DBT_PROJECT_DIR} --profiles-dir ../`
where `DBT_PROJECT_DIR` is your dbt directory in relative to the docker airflow container
mine was `DBT_PROJECT_DIR = ""../../opt/dbt/&lt;dbt project name&gt;""`

1. Read and research on prompt engineering and its algorithms
    a. understand transformer algorithm
    b. understand basics of GPT
2. Then, I believe the next step after setting up your repo is EDA on the given datasets and customizing the data to get better performances(results) from the co:here api.
    a. you will be working on creating the best input data out of the given dataset
    b. you consume the co:here API (simply send you prepared data to the api and you receive predictions from the model)
    c. Finally you put all these steps together by creating your own API
    d. your API should have two end-point ( i think they behave more or less the same): one endpoint for the news scoring and the other endpoint for extracting entities from job description
        i. So here is what you will do: your api should accept dataset(in json format possibly) then you transform, clean, feature engineer, the received data through your pipeline then send the prepared data to the co:here API, (notice there are two APIs involving in this project)....then you present the results via UI
Your API accept data-&gt;you transform data through pipeline-&gt;send prepared data to co:here-&gt; receive predictions -&gt; return the results to the user via UI

Most people are mirrors, reflecting the moods and emotions of the times; few are windows, bringing light to bear on the dark corners where troubles fester.

<!channel> Having received a number of complaints or clarity about leaderboard scores, it’s imperative to give a detailed explanation on how leaderboard scores are calculated. 

It is essential to note that the following components constitute your leaderboard scores: 
• Technical submission 
• Non-technical submission 
• Standup and tutorial attendance 
• Slack participation 
There are standard scores for each of these components. On the leaderboard section of tenx, we have ‘*week score*’ and ‘*previous week* score’ - your week score is the cumulative of all previous weeks including the present week. For example, the *week score*  of the week 5 leaderboard is the cumulative of week1 to week5, not week 5 alone. You can also view this example like the grading system of university CGPA. Consequently, your previous weeks scores will affect all your new scores.

If you have any further question, you can kindly reach out to me. Do have a restful weekend and a great month ahead. ",U03TEPYRM2P,all-broadcast

• *Set small goals*: The thought of completing one huge task can seem daunting. Having a list of small and achievable goals can help you tackle each one, in turn, meaning that you make gradual progress towards completion.
• *Organize your tasks*: The point above feeds into this one. You can stay motivated to accomplish your main goals by creating a precise schedule with dates (daily, weekly and monthly) for when you will achieve each of your smaller goals.
•  *Focus your attention*: Concentrating on some of the simpler activities you need to complete is another method for overcoming procrastination. This is a major confidence booster to achieve set tasks
• *Remove distractions*: They can easily derail your progress, whether it’s having your phone next to you on your desk or having the TV on in the background. Ensure you create a comfortable working environment where distractions can't thrive.
• *Forgive yourself*: It's easy to punish yourself for putting off tasks. You might tell yourself that you're being ineffective or lazy. In actuality, doing this to yourself doesn't increase productivity; it just makes you feel more agitated and nervous. So learn to forgive yourself always.

Welcome to 10 Academy slack workspace. We will be using this platform to communicate with the trainees and share resources needed throughout the training. To have a well organized workspace, we have created different channels for specific purposes. The following are the list of channels in this workspace and their respective purposes:

*<#C03U4J8J4LQ|all-broadcast> ;* This channel will be used for sharing important information and announcements such as weekly schedule, session reminders, leaderboard and so on. Only 10 Academy team can post on this channel.

<#C03T89KDGA2|all-career-exercises>: This channel will be used for sharing career related issues and exercises. Trainees should adopt this channel to ask questions and share resources that are peculiar to Career. This channel is open for all trainees.

<#C03T0AX4K6K|all-technical-support>: Trainees should adopt this channel to ask questions related to tenx platform, google classroom, google meet and slack platform.

<#C03T89PMJKG|all-resources>: For easy easy access to resources shared, trainees should use this channel to share valuable resources such as books, videos, articles and so on.

*<#C03TEQQS9NF|all-week1>* : This channel is used for asking questions related to week1 challenge. 10 Academy tutors will be available to answer your questions as fast as possible. However, trainees can also answer another trainee’s questions - provided he/she is sure of the answer. In addition, trainees should answer questions in a thread so that the channel can be organized and other trainees can also benefit from such questions. Please note that we will always create a new channel weekly such as #all-week2, #all-week3 and so on.

*<#C03T0APHX63|all-community-building>  :* This group was created with the objective of growing a formidable bond among batch 6 trainees and 10 Academy team. We will be using this channel for community building sessions, social and community building discussions.  This channel is open to all trainees.


*<#C03TBUCU4UD|random>  :* This group is for discussions that are not related to the training such as choice of music, politics, football and so on.

It is imperative to inform all trainees to have mutual respect for fellow trainees and avoid use of offensive words.",U03TEPYRM2P,all-broadcast

We have so far managed to work on real project from different clients:
• week 11 - Adludio 
• week 9 - Gokada 
Alert: Adludio has reached us with a claim that some of trainees have shared related data in public places (public Github, medium, LinkedIn, etc)

Note that this is contrary to the NDA that you signed and can affect our partnership with a client!

ACTION - Priority - Adludio  (please check your github and other blog post as soon as possible):

Lena is a frontend engineer coming from the interdisciplinary field of Digital Humanities. Her goal is to diversify tech intersectional. She works with H.E.R. DAO to bring scholars to blockchain conferences and hackathons because she believes this is an important step to prevent coded biases that are happening in web2 for web3. Since 2021 Lena has been learning about web3, web3 development and is actively working in creating a mentorship network for female and non-binary developer.

Another important step to making web3 more inclusive is to bring an awareness for wellbeing. To achieve this goal Lena is working on Proof of Meditation, a dApp to incentivise people to meditate more",U03V1AM5TFA,all-broadcast

I think of it like this.

Kitchens in a restaurant, serving hundreds of people.
• Data Scientists are the head chefs, figuring out the recipes that people want to eat and which fit the budget.
• ML Engineers do the cooking for people at scale.  They use the ingredients from DEng and the recipes from DSci.
• Data Engineers ensure that all the ingredients are coming into the kitchen, prepared and ready.  No ingredients, no food. Choosing good quality ingredients and preparing them well is hard.
• MLOps folks build and maintain the kitchen infrastructure (stoves, ovens, etc.).

data scientist can do what data engineer do? but is reverse ok?

And therefore the Aluminis advice might not be applicable to some and might be even bottom line impossible for others. And therefore I would like to recommend to you based on my imperceptible wisdom to have your own schedule at the beginning of the week. Take a look at that week's challenge doc. see what we are supposed to deliver (on the deliverables section) and after you understand what we need to complete and by when you then plan out the week. Now I think the most important part about the schedule is following it, you might not complete everything on time, and you might finish some before the allotted time frame ends, But for the unfinished tasks don't waste too much unscheduled time on them, as they will definitely take up the other tasks time. So by planning and following your schedule even if you don't complete everything you might manage to get lots done.

Last but not least, don't forget other areas of your life in the meantime. Everyday balance is very necessary and is definitely, at least for me, what constitutes the good life.

The memory I still use as a guideline was the way my mom punished me. She gave me extra 3 Birr and ordered me to buy an other hand watch of the same type. For a while, I took it to buy but later on I cried a lot alone and returned back the watch to the owner and bring my 3 birr. I gave 6 birr to my mom. She laughed at me. I was confused and asked her why? why she didn't punish me an other way? I cried in front of her. I repented and have never tried to stole from then on. That was really harsh but polite punishment.

• *Set small goals*: The thought of completing one huge task can seem daunting. Having a list of small and achievable goals can help you tackle each one, in turn, meaning that you make gradual progress towards completion.
• *Organize your tasks*: The point above feeds into this one. You can stay motivated to accomplish your main goals by creating a precise schedule with dates (daily, weekly and monthly) for when you will achieve each of your smaller goals.
•  *Focus your attention*: Concentrating on some of the simpler activities you need to complete is another method for overcoming procrastination. This is a major confidence booster to achieve set tasks
• *Remove distractions*: They can easily derail your progress, whether it’s having your phone next to you on your desk or having the TV on in the background. Ensure you create a comfortable working environment where distractions can't thrive.
• *Forgive yourself*: It's easy to punish yourself for putting off tasks. You might tell yourself that you're being ineffective or lazy. In actuality, doing this to yourself doesn't increase productivity; it just makes you feel more agitated and nervous. So learn to forgive yourself always.

I think of it like this.

Kitchens in a restaurant, serving hundreds of people.
• Data Scientists are the head chefs, figuring out the recipes that people want to eat and which fit the budget.
• ML Engineers do the cooking for people at scale.  They use the ingredients from DEng and the recipes from DSci.
• Data Engineers ensure that all the ingredients are coming into the kitchen, prepared and ready.  No ingredients, no food. Choosing good quality ingredients and preparing them well is hard.
• MLOps folks build and maintain the kitchen infrastructure (stoves, ovens, etc.).

data scientist can do what data engineer do? but is reverse ok?

slightly_smiling_face,2,"U03UJGRN5E0,U03UJN29Y4C","One of my favourite analogies is the one used to describe Zero Knowledge Proofs.
Normally, if you want to send a crypto asset, say Bitcoin, the network would first verify if you have the said amount of Bitcoin in the first place. But for privacy conscious users of blockchain, Zero Knowledge Proof provide a cryptographic proof of ownership without revealing too much information to the network.
Though a zero-knowledge proof is a sophisticated method of authenticating a transaction without revealing much details about it, the analogy below breaks down its most basic function.

Let's say <@U03UUMM7Y8H> is colourblind but doesn't know it. Now <@U03UKGSDGSG> needs to proof to Yasabneh that there's a difference between green and red. She gives Yasabneh two snooker balls, one green and one red but they are otherwise identical.

Yasabneh couldn't see the difference and he's pretty skeptical. To verify Hermela's claim that they are indeed different in colour, he device a proof system.

Yasabneh holds one snooker ball in each hand and put them behind his back. He either switches the balls or just leaves them be.

There's an equal chance of switching and not switching. He then brings them out from his back. Hermela now has to guess whether Yasabneh switched the balls or not. She can know with certainty whether Yasabneh switched the balls just by looking at the colours because she's not colourblind.

If she had lied, and the balls were of the same colour, then she only has 50% probability of guessing the switches correctly. So, one try wouldn't be enough to get Yasabneh convinced. Yasabneh and Hermela then go ahead to repeat this proof multiple times.

With each time Hermela gets it right, the chance it was just plan luck goes away. Yasabneh eventually is convinced that the balls are of different colours.

The proof is zero-knowledge because Yasabneh never learns which ball is green and which one is red. He just knows they're different colours.",U03UJN29Y4C,all-resources

1. Read and research on prompt engineering and its algorithms
    a. understand transformer algorithm

2. Then, I believe the next step after setting up your repo is EDA on the given datasets and customizing the data to get better performances(results) from the co:here api.

    b. you consume the co:here API (simply send you prepared data to the api and you receive predictions from the model)

    d. your API should have two end-point ( i think they behave more or less the same): one endpoint for the news scoring and the other endpoint for extracting entities from job description
        i. So here is what you will do: your api should accept dataset(in json format possibly) then you transform, clean, feature engineer, the received data through your pipeline then send the prepared data to the co:here API, (notice there are two APIs involving in this project)....then you present the results via UI

    d. your API should have two end-point ( i think they behave more or less the same): one endpoint for the news scoring and the other endpoint for extracting entities from job description
        i. So here is what you will do: your api should accept dataset(in json format possibly) then you transform, clean, feature engineer, the received data through your pipeline then send the prepared data to the co:here API, (notice there are two APIs involving in this project)....then you present the results via UI
Your API accept data-&gt;you transform data through pipeline-&gt;send prepared data to co:here-&gt; receive predictions -&gt; return the results to the user via UI

Semantic Segmentation
Semantic Segmentation is the task of segmenting parts of an image that belong to the same class. Semantic Segmentation models make predictions for each pixel and return the probabilities of the classes for each pixel. These models are evaluated on Mean Intersection Over Union (Mean IoU).

Instance Segmentation
Instance Segmentation is the variant of Image Segmentation where every distinct object is segmented, instead of one segment per class.

Panoptic Segmentation
Panoptic Segmentation is the Image Segmentation task that segments the image both by instance and by class, assigning each pixel a different instance of the class.",U03UVHCV6KB,all-week11

+1,2,"U03UFV7TUTV,U03UJN29Y4C","I definitely caused some confusion so to clear things up --

From a fresh setup, you start off with these commands by initializing a git and a DVC repository
```git init
dvc init
git commit -m ""initial commit""```
You then follow on to set the DVC remote -- this is the MOST crucial step and should be done first because messing with different remotes and then tracking the changes on multiple unsynchronized remotes will lead to unnecessary complications as we saw.
```dvc remote add -d myremote <gdrive://folderid>
git commit -m ""sets dvc remote""```
the remote URL can be in your local file system but using google drive will be really helpful for collaboration as you are working in teams. Please follow this <https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/setup-google-drive-remote|link> to learn more.

After this will follow the steps where you will actually track the data.
```dvc add path_to_data
git add path_to_data.dvc
git commit -m ""data:track""```
You then tag the specific commit and then push it to your DVC remote using `dvc push`
```git tag -a 'v1' -m ""raw data""
dvc push```
The final two steps are the only steps that are necessary and the steps you'll iterate over and over once DVC and your DVC remote are set and you start making changes to your data.",U03V8LHPDME,all-week2

Q2 - How did you get to your current status as a (MLEng, DataEng)
Q3 - Take me through a project that you are proud of
Q4 - 3-4 questions that you would ask them for the role/company

For Q1 - forget the job, tell them about you to start. Give them a why, if you have one. What is important to you.
• Your name in  full
• Where you live
• What you are doing right now
• What your university education was - which course. Mention notable courses and projects. Mention challenges as well, if any.
• Link to 10 Academy - why did you apply? How does it link to your future goals.
• Overview of what you learned at 10 Academy. Sprinkle in keywords on technologies that you have used. Look at the list of expertise keywords in the careers doc.
• You don't need to close it off with a 'hire me' - it's one part of the discussion.
• You should feel free to talk about things that you like. Your parents, kids, cats, neighbours....etc.
It's a summary of who you are and where you come from

For Q2 - Your background in MLEng and Data Eng
• Start with your university - which courses did you take that were relevant?
• Highlight your math and your algorithms and other related courses
• Talk about student projects or internships that were relevant - mention them in the frame of MLEng or DEng - what aspects of them were related
• Talk about 10 Academy and highlight 2-3 key projects that you are proud of, and which could be related to what the employer is interested in. If the job is NLP, talk about Speech to Text and especially the processing part.  If the job is ETL, talk about your pipeline buliding
• Talk about any self-learning including which resources you used
• Give a summary of your background at the end as it relates to the whole stack. So that you have some background in Data Eng, you have worked on different models, you have deep expertise in Python and SQL, you have done some CI/CD and ML DevOps, visualization and reporting. Tie it together and show that you know where your expertise fits in the overall context.
Q3 - Be ready to walk them through a project that is relevant, in a lot of detail.
• Have your notebook clean and ready to present and walk though.
• Be ready to explain approaches you took
• Be ready to explain why you chose one approach over other approaches
• Be ready to talk about things that you realize you didn't do as well as you could have
• Be ready to talk about things that you would have implemented, given the time
• Be ready to talk about where you would take the project next
Q4 - Prepare questions for the company and the role
• This is one of the most important things - it’s your opportunity to showcase the type of thinker that you are.
• Ask meaningful questions that you would be likely to ask if you started work and it was Day 1.

Try to use a distributed system if you want to go for DB instead of using a non-distributed system which could be a single-point of failure and you should be able to show how secure it is because NFT management needs to be very secure.

And your application should communicate with your kafka cluster. Then apply spark to transform and load your audio data from the kafka cluster.

Semantic Segmentation
Semantic Segmentation is the task of segmenting parts of an image that belong to the same class. Semantic Segmentation models make predictions for each pixel and return the probabilities of the classes for each pixel. These models are evaluated on Mean Intersection Over Union (Mean IoU).

Instance Segmentation
Instance Segmentation is the variant of Image Segmentation where every distinct object is segmented, instead of one segment per class.

Panoptic Segmentation
Panoptic Segmentation is the Image Segmentation task that segments the image both by instance and by class, assigning each pixel a different instance of the class.",U03UVHCV6KB,all-week11

And therefore the Aluminis advice might not be applicable to some and might be even bottom line impossible for others. And therefore I would like to recommend to you based on my imperceptible wisdom to have your own schedule at the beginning of the week. Take a look at that week's challenge doc. see what we are supposed to deliver (on the deliverables section) and after you understand what we need to complete and by when you then plan out the week. Now I think the most important part about the schedule is following it, you might not complete everything on time, and you might finish some before the allotted time frame ends, But for the unfinished tasks don't waste too much unscheduled time on them, as they will definitely take up the other tasks time. So by planning and following your schedule even if you don't complete everything you might manage to get lots done.

Time management
Communicating with people remotely
There exists a big skill gap in tech in  Africa as compared to the world. 
Learning can be fun!
How to ask good questions
From the debate sessions, we should respect everyone's opinions.
Work output  stretches it self to the time you give it.
patience --code not work.......
They say it takes 60 days to create a habit, at 10 Academy , I definitely developed a habit of solving Data engineering and ML problems through coding.```
